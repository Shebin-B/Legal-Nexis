        <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>All users, including clients, lawyers, and admins, must provide accurate information during registration. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and are liable for any activities under your account.</p>

        <h2>3. Appointment Requests</h2>

        <h2>5. Communication and Fees</h2>
        <p>Once an appointment request is accepted, clients and lawyers may communicate via phone or email to discuss case details and set terms. Lawyers can send a fee request, and clients are obligated to pay only after a fee request has been initiated.</p>

        <h2>6. Profile and Reports</h2>
        <p>Each user is provided with a profile to manage their appointments and activities. Reports on client-lawyer interactions are available for tracking purposes but are not admissible in court as evidence.</p>
